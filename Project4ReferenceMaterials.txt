Office Hours – Optimizations for Project 4 (twice)
•	updatePositions is function that must be optimized
•	what are the exact numbers that phase and scrollTop use … can we streamline this?
o	Get whatever calculations can be removed from the for loop to outside.
o	It’s the same 5 numbers for all pizzas – how do we optimize this? Store 5 numbers and use them to change element position.
o	Use transform property to change left position on each pizza
o	Force elements in layer using (pizza_stage2, 3)
	Transform: translateX() 
	Transform: translateZ()
	Transform: translate3D()
	Backface-visibility: hidden
o	How many pizzas do we need to animate?
o	Only paint moving pizza’s (render pizzas into individual layers)
o	User backface-visibility: hidden to reduce paint ---put in ‘mover’ class
o	Go to rendering and select show composited border layers
